## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `seeder` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:seeder, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can

# ExDns.Seeder: Detailed Implementation Plan

---

## Component Overview

**ExDns.Seeder** is responsible for generating and seeding DNS records from external sources into your system. It serves as the entry point for all DNS data and ensures the system has fresh and relevant data for resolution.

![ExDns Seeder Architecture](./exdns-seeder-architecture.svg)

---
## Architecture Components

1. **Main GenServer**
    - Core process for managing the seeding lifecycle
    - Maintains state for seeding operations
    - Handles scheduling and coordination

2. **Python Interface**
    - ErlPort integration for Python communication
    - Data transformation between Elixir and Python
    - Error handling for external process failures

3. **Scheduling Logic**
    - Timer-based scheduling for periodic seeding
    - Configurable intervals and batch sizes
    - Throttling mechanisms for resource management

4. **Event Broadcasting**
    - PubSub integration for system notifications
    - Event normalization and formatting
    - Subscriber management

---

## Data Flow Sequence

### 1. Initialization Flow
- `ExDns.Seeder` GenServer starts during application boot
- Establishes connection to Python runtime via ErlPort
- Loads configuration parameters (intervals, domains, etc.)
- Schedules first seeding operation

### 2. Regular Seeding Flow
- Timer triggers scheduled seeding operation
- Seeder prepares parameters for Python script
- Python script generates DNS records based on parameters
- Records returned to Elixir process
- Validation and normalization of returned data
- Bulk insertion into `ExDns.Storage`
- Event broadcast notifying system of new records
- Next seeding operation scheduled

### 3. Event Publication Flow
- Seeding completion generates events
- Events published to PubSub system
- Subscribers (like caches, resolvers) react to new data
- Metrics collected for seeding operations

---

## Data Schemas

### Seeder Configuration Schema

```elixir
%{
  interval: 1_800_000,  # 30 minutes in milliseconds
  batch_size: 100,
  domains: ["com", "org", "net", "io", "tech"],
  python_path: "/path/to/python_scripts",
  seed_types: ["A", "AAAA", "MX", "CNAME", "TXT"],
  ttl_range: {300, 86400}  # min/max TTL in seconds
}
```

### Python Script Input Format

```elixir
%{
  domains: ["com", "org", "net", "io", "tech"],
  count: 100,
  types: ["A", "AAAA", "MX", "CNAME", "TXT"],
  ttl_range: {300, 86400},
  timestamp: 1618572800
}
```

### Python Script Output Format

```elixir
[
  %{
    domain: "example.com",
    type: "A",
    ttl: 3600,
    value: "192.168.1.1"
  },
  %{
    domain: "mail.example.org",
    type: "MX",
    ttl: 7200,
    priority: 10,
    value: "mailserver.example.org"
  }
  # More records...
]
```

### Seeding Event Schema

```elixir
%{
  event: :dns_records_seeded,
  count: 100,
  domains: ["com", "org", "net", "io", "tech"],
  timestamp: 1618572800,
  duration_ms: 1250
}
```
